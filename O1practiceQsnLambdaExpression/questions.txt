===================Lambda Expression questions==================
1.Write a lambda expression to check if a given number is even or odd.

2.Use a lambda expression to find the square of a number.

3.Implement a lambda function that takes a list of integers and prints only the even numbers.

4.Create a lambda expression that concatenates two strings and returns the result.

5.Convert a normal anonymous class into a lambda expression:

-----intermediate------
6.Given a list of strings, use a lambda expression to sort them in ascending order.

7.Use a lambda function inside removeIf() to remove all negative numbers from a list.

8.Implement a lambda expression that finds the sum of all even numbers in a list.

9.Convert a lambda expression into a method reference.

10.Write a lambda expression to convert all strings in a list to uppercase.

==================Functional Interface Questions ====================
 -----------Beginner-------
11.Implement a Consumer<String> that prints the given string.

12.Implement a Supplier<Integer> that returns a random number between 1 and 100.

13.Implement a Predicate<String> that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

14.Implement a Function<Integer, String> that converts an integer to its binary string.

15.Implement a BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> to find the sum of two numbers.

----------Intermediate---------
16.Given a list of numbers, use a Predicate<Integer> to filter out all numbers greater than 50.

17.Write a program that applies a UnaryOperator<Integer> to double all elements in a list.

18.Implement a BiPredicate<String, String> that checks if two strings are anagrams.

19.Use a BinaryOperator<Integer> to find the maximum of two numbers.

20.Implement a custom functional interface with two methods and test if it compiles.


=======================Method Reference=====================
 -----------Beginner--------
21.Convert the following lambda expression into a method reference:

22.Use a method reference to refer to a static method that calculates the square of a number.

23.Use a method reference to call an instance method that converts a string to lowercase.

24.Use a constructor reference to create a new object of a class.

25.Convert this lambda into a method reference:

----------Intermediate---------
26.Given a class MathUtils with an instance method multiply(int a, int b), create a method reference for it.

27.Create a method reference for a method that checks if a string is empty.

28.Convert the following into a method reference:

29.Implement a functional interface that refers to a non-static method without creating an instance.

30. Use a method reference to sort a list of strings by their lengths.

==========mini project===
 Implement a real-world example using all three topics: Lambda expressions, Functional Interfaces, and Method References. Example:
✔️ Filter employee salaries using Predicate
✔️ Print all names using Consumer
✔️ Sort employees using Method Reference
